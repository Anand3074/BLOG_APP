## Installation

We've streamlined the installation process to get you started quickly. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure you have the necessary development tools like Git, Node.js (with npm), and MongoDB installed on your machine.

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Anand3074/BLOG_APP.git

**Install Dependencies:**

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies for both the server and client applications.

## Database Setup

1. Install and configure MongoDB according to its official documentation.
2. Provide the database connection details in the application configuration file (details on location provided below).

## Running the Application

**Server:**

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Start the development server using `npm run dev`. This will typically launch the server application and listen for requests.

**Client:**

1. Navigate to the `App_Blog` directory within the project.
2. Start the development server for the client-side application using `npm run dev`. This will typically launch the client application at `http://localhost:3000` (port might vary) in your web browser.

## Deployment

(Instructions on deploying the application to a production environment will be added in a future update.Â For now, the focus is on local development.)

## Configuration

The application configuration file (`config.js` or similar) holds various settings like database connection details, port numbers, JWT secret key (for authentication), and other environment variables. Refer to the comments within the configuration file for specific instructions on customization.

## Additional Notes

* Feel free to create a `.env` file to store sensitive information like database credentials and JWT secret key to avoid committing them to your version control system.
* We recommend using a linter and code formatter to maintain code quality and consistency. Consider adding configuration files for tools like ESLint and Prettier to the project.
* Unit tests are highly encouraged to ensure code stability and functionality. Explore adding a testing framework like Jest to your project.
